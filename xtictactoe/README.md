# First Project: Extended TicTacToe

In this project you should implement the game logic for a simple Tic-Tac-Toe
console game. You will have to work with the `Option`, `Either` and `List`
types from the scala standard library. See the
[scala documentation](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/) for
information.

The project compiles and can be run. However, it is lacking most of the
required functionality.

## Task

You are to implement a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game. This should be
achieved by exchanging the stubs in
[Logic.scala](src/main/scala/xtictactoe/Logic.scala) with a proper
implementation. See the comments in that file for details on the functions.

__There are many possible ways to implement the functions.__

It is an important part of the exercise to examine the provided structure
and explore possible solutions with the help of the scala documentation.

__We encourage you to work in groups.__

## Project Layout

The project is split into 3 files. The one most relevant to you is
[Logic.scala](src/main/scala/xtictactoe/Logic.scala). It contains stub
implementations for 4 functions. It is your task to understand the role
of each function and to provide a proper implementation.

Additionally, there are 2 more files:
- [Game.scala](src/main/scala/xtictactoe/Game.scala) contains the game
loop and interaction code
- [Console.scala](src/main/scala/xtictactoe/Console.scala) contains utility
functions to interact with the console

While you should not change anything in these files, feel free to explore
them. Keep in mind, that they contain advanced concepts not yet covered
in the lectures.
